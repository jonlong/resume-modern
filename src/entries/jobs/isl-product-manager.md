Led the agency's first **R&D** team dedicated to the development of internal products.

Focused on tools to take the pain out of daily reporting and balance workloads across teams. Resulting data provided managers with actionable insights and heads-up notifications to uncover workflow trends and enable proactive decision-making.

Used **Lean Startup** methodology to identify success factors, and extensive prototyping and research sessions to validate ideas through build-measure-learn feedback loops.

Facilitated discovery workshops across each division of the company, cross-collaborative design sessions, product feedback interviews, and pitches to both internal management and external agency owners.

Constructed low-fidelity paper and **Sketch**-based **prototypes**, interactive mockups with **Keynote**, and **After Effects**, and a web-based **MVP** application with **Meteor** and **Sails** realtime frameworks (**Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **Socket.io**).
