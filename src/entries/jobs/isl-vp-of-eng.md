Led a team of software engineers to produce internal projects and client campaigns for some of the world's largest brands.

Responsible for team **management**, **full-stack development**, company-wide **technical direction**, staffing, and **technical project management**.

Project highlights include:

- **Redd's Apple Launcher**: An experiential campaign for **MillerCoors** in which participants used their web browsers to fire an internet-connected apple launcher onsite at a bar built on a Washington, DC soundstage. When physical targets were hit on set, the application would automatically assign, fulfill, and distribute real-world prizes to the participant. The experience featured an **in-browser FPS-style game** built with **Angular** and **Socket.io**, **Facebook Connect**, a third-party prize **API**, and Grandstand **hardware integration**.
- **Deloitte University Press**: A publishing platform built for Deloitte to house original thought leadership, periodicals, and reports on a variety of topics in the public and private sectors. Featured a **custom publishing workflow** in **WordPress**, a **responsive front end**, and a **custom plugin** designed to generate articles from **InDesign** files.
- **SimplyGifted (Gannett)**: A gift card platform designed for local businesses, and powered by Gannett's third-party deals API. Included integration with an in-progress **internal API**, client-side site development, a **Yii**-based backend, and the development of an **embeddable JavaScript widget** that vendors could use to sell gift cards on their own sites with a single line of code.
- **Yappem**: A mobile application with the goal of incentivizing brand and product feedback. I led the **UX** and **IA** for this project, delivering **wireframes**, **workflow diagrams**, **interactive prototypes**, and detailed spec sheets.
