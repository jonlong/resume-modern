Co-created a company-wide [**design system**](https://stackup-ui.promptworks.com/) used as a baseline for nearly all of the company's greenfield projects since 2020. Enabled teams to ship high-quality interfaces in a matter of weeks instead of months, without dedicated UI resources.

Created a Front End Working Group that generated company-wide **project guidelines** and strategies for **UI development**. Directly empowered an engineering team largely specializing in backend development to ship fast, consistent, high-quality UI work, and complete end-to-end features without intervention.

Shipped UI for projects using **React**, **React Native**, **Vue**, **Angular**, and **Jinja** component systems, established **client-side testing** strategies, and generated **QA** plans for complex **integration testing**.

Used a **design systems** approach to sucessfully redesign an 8000+ page content site without a budget for dedicated design resources.

Acted as **Tech Lead** on projects ranging from content sites to **A/B testing** a mobile delivery app with **millions of users**. Regularly led client meetings, presentations, and demos. Modeled a positive and inclusive approach to collaboration through working agreements, 1-on-1 retros with teammates, pairing with junior and senior colleagues, and delivering thoughtful feedback in code reviews.

One of three employees offered an ownership position in the company.
